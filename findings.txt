Initial analysis of data:
 - total pitches -> 12,630
 - fastballs -> 6,874 (54.43%)
 - off-speed -> 5,755 (44.47%)

Variable-Selection:
-	Log regression with all classifiers:
    - Optimal number of features determined to be given ROC_AUC: 8
    - Descending order of importance, using ROC_AUC to keep only those helping classify 
	   (1, 'prev_pitch_class,o_count,f_count,on_3b,on_2b,pitch_num,s_count,b_count')
		(2, 'top')
		(3, 'inning')
		(4, 'outs')
		(5, 'on_1b')
		(6, 'p_score')
		(7, 'stand')
		(8, 'b_score')
	- Optimal number of features given accuracy: 5
	- Parameters by descending order of importance:
		(1, 'prev_pitch_class,o_count,f_count,pitch_num,b_count')
		(2, 's_count')
		(3, 'on_2b')
		(4, 'on_3b')
		(5, 'top')
		(6, 'inning')
		(7, 'outs')
		(8, 'on_1b')
		(9, 'p_score')
		(10, 'stand')
		(11, 'b_score')
	- So prev_pitch_class, o_count, f_count, pitch_num and b_count are definately good predictors.  [s_count, on_2b, on_3b] seem
	    to assist in AUC but not with accuracy.  The rest are not really helpful.
