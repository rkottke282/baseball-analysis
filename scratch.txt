1) Use predictors to see if there's a linear pattern
    - need a basic result -> 0 (fastball) or 1 (offspeed pitch)
    - can get into more classification -> 0 (fast), 1 (offspeed), 2 (breaking)
    - determine helpful predictors
        - forward or backward selection

2) Add more predictors that may be helpful
    - previous pitch
    - number of fastballs/offspeeds thrown in this at bat
    - pitch distribution that day

3) Situationally
    - classifier by count

4) Neural Network

5) Logistical Regression
